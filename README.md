# WordAnalyzer
A simple React Native mobile application that analyzes any word

This app was developped following these steps:

(1) Create a text box to accept user input

(2) create a function to analyze the word by (i) turning the string into an array of characters (ii)using said array and a loop to determine the characteristic of each word (a) if it was a consonant or a vowel, add to the count of each respective variable (b) if it is a space of a special character, remove from the counting entirely (this means that this program only counts consonants and vowels)

(3) create a display to show the user the results
